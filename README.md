# My Simple Calculator

I made this very basic calculator program in C. It can add, subtract, or divide two whole numbers you enter.

## How to Use It

1.  **Compile:** If you have a C compiler (like GCC), just save my code as `calculator.c` and compile it by typing `gcc calculator.c -o calculator` in your terminal.
2.  **Run:** Then, type `./calculator` and follow the instructions on your screen.

It'll ask you for two numbers, and then what you want to do with them (add, subtract, or divide).

## Important Note

* I included a prompt for a third decimal number (`c`), but I didn't actually use it for any calculations in this version.
* Be careful when dividing! If you try to divide a number by zero, the program might not work correctly.
